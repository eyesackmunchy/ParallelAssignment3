# ParallelAssignment3

This does not do anything besides set up the presents. :(
I started this project way too late because I was busy with SD2.
I will finish this project (unfortunately after the deadline) and just hope that Professor Parra accepts it. Prayge
Or maybe just some pity points so I don't fail this class
